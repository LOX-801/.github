## 🧭 Overview

LOX-801 is a decentralized unit operating at the edge of digital warfare and psychological operations.  
We engineer cryptographic protocols, develop offensive tooling, and execute civilian-grade intelligence frameworks.

This is not a company.  
This is not a movement.  
This is a cold network of autonomous operators — operating under noise.
